<h1> Mango Float </h1> <!-- Main heading for the recipe title -->

<p> The Filipino icebox cake dish known as "mango float" or "cr√®me de mangga" is made up of layers of ripe carabao mangoes, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ladyfingers (broas) or graham crackers. Before serving, it is refrigerated for a few hours, but it can also be frozen to make it more like ice cream. </p>

        <h1>Valorant</h1>
        <p>
            Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, is the developer and publisher of Valorant, a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter (FPS). Valorant, which was formally released in June 2020, has been extremely popular because of its competitive gameplay, combination of tactical gunplay, and special character-based skills.<br>
            With events like the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) bringing international teams and millions of spectators, Valorant offers an active esports culture. Both casual gamers and professional supporters love the game because of its tactical depth, emphasis on teamwork, and high skill level. <br>

            Valorant might be a game worth checking out if you enjoy fast-paced, cooperative shooters that call for collaboration, smart thinking, and accurate aim!

        <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>5V5 Tactical Shooter:</b> In a match, two teams of five players battle. While one team appears to be the attackers and attempts to place a "spike"—basically a bomb—at specific bomb sites, the other team appears to be the defenders and tries to stop the spike from being planted or defuse it once it has been planted.</li><br>
            <li><b>Objecitive-Based Rounds:</b> The first team to win 13 rounds (in the majority of settings) wins the match. Each match is divided into many rounds. Halfway through, teams switch between attacking and defending.</li><br>
            <li><b>Characters with Abilities:</b> Valorant has a wide cast of characters known as Agents, in contrast to more traditional tactical shooters like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Every agent have an individual set of skills that provide strategic depth. These skills include healing, teleportation, smokes, flashes, and more.</li><br>
            <li><b>Tactical Gunplay:</b> The gunplay in Valorant prioritizes accuracy, management of recoil, and cooperation despite the character's abilities. Some of the weapons are shotguns, snipers, handguns, rifles (such as the Phantom or Vandal), and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Game Modes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Unrated (Standard Mode):</b> a full match where teams race to win 13 rounds.</li>
            <li><b>Competitive (Rank Mode):</b> ranks (such as Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Radiant) in a more serious form.</li>
            <li><b>Spike Rush:</b> a shorter, faster-paced mode.</li>
            <li><b>Deathmatch:</b> a pure gunplay mode without abilities, focusing on aim practice</li>
            <li><b>Custom Games and Rotating Modes:</b> features interesting, limited-time modes and events</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>Four specific duties are assigned to agents, each of which is intended to carry out a certain purpose during a match. These positions include Sentinels, Controllers, Duelists, and Initiators. Depending on their individual skills, each role makes a different contribution to the team's performance.</p>

        <h3>Duelists</h3>
        <p>The independent fraggers known as duelists are made to engage in combative battles and score kills. They are excellent at starting fights and opening doors by taking out rivals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Role Objective:</b> Entry fragging, initiating fights, taking space aggressively.</li>
            <li><b>Playstyle:</b> Aggressive, kill-focused, and designed to win duels.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Agents:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Jett: <i>A mobile agent with dashes, smokes, and an ultimate (Bladestorm) involving throwing deadly knives.</i></li>
            <li>Reyna: <i>After obtaining frags, she may temporarily turn invisible or heal herself. She thrives on getting kills to gain strength.</i></li>
            <li>Phoenix: <i>He has the ability to heal himself with his flames and has an ultimate that allows him to live again after being "eliminated."</i></li>
            <li>Raze: <i>For maximum damage, use explosive skills like rocket launchers and grenades.</i></li>
            <li>Yoru: <i>Able to confuse opponents by using teleportation, invisibility, and fake footsteps.</i></li>
